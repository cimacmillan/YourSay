# Your-say(dot)net
Website created for 3rd year webtech project

This website is a conceptual site for voting on parliamentary bills. The idea is members of a
constituency vote on bills, where the MP for that constituency (from a new political party) is
bound to vote on the overall result from that constituency, found from the site. The idea is
that itâ€™s a kind of modern-day direct democracy.

It is currently innactive but an instance can be started with **Node** and **start.js**
